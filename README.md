# WooCommerce Freshbook Automatic Sync Extension

This is a plugin to automatically update your order status based on the freshbook invoices status.
* Currently working only up to WC 3.0 versions! (Compatibility with earlier versions are in my backlog).*

## How to use?

Just install and active the plugin, done, that's all!
For now the plugin is working with a cron, being fired hourly.

Obs.: Probably you know this, but:
1. First of all: are already using the plugins WooCommece and WooCommerce Freshbooks.
2. Have added your Fresbook API credentials.

## Things that I need to fix/improve

- [ ] Add an options page to set more options to fire the cron (e.g: daily, weekly... and also with custom time).
- [ ] Add compatibility to use with WooCommerce 3.0 earlier versions.

Pull-requests are incredibly welcome, lol!
