# WooCommerce Freshbook Automatic Sync Extension

This is a plugin to automatically update your order status based on the freshbook invoices status.

## How to use?

Just install and active the plugin, done, that's all!
For now the plugin is working with a cron, being fired hourly.

Obs.: You need first of all are aleady using the plugins WooCommerce Freshbooks and also have added your Fresbook API credentials.

## Somethings that I need to fix/improve

* Add an options page to set more options to fire the cron (e.g: daily, weekly... and also with custom time.)
* Add compatibility to use with WooCommerce 3.0 earlier versions.
